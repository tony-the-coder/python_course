## File Descriptions

### Practice Labs
These assigned practice labs cover various fundamental Python concepts and functionalities. Each lab focuses on a specific skill like functions, loops, or data manipulation.

- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_1.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_1.py)**: Contains the `format_rgb` function to format RGB values.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_2.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_2.py)**: Contains the `minutes_to_hours` function to convert minutes to hours.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_3.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_3.py)**: Contains the `update_log_list` function to update log entries.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_4.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_4.py)**: Contains the `validate_id` function to validate employee IDs.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_5.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_5.py)**: This was just correcting mistakes in the lab as part of the quix
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_6.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_6.py)**: Looping practice as a oneliner, with another test, and an if statement. 
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_7.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_7.py)**: Contains the `write_dict_to_csv` function to write dictionary data to a CSV file.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_8.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_8.py)**: Contains the `write_dict_to_csv` function to write dictionary data to a CSV file.
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_9.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_9.py)**: A for-loop to convert items to a datetime and I needed to find a max. The loop was not the best, so I used a generator and the loop left in for me to review if needed. . 
- **[practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_10.py](practice_before_the_test/practice_lab_10.py)**: Another review of the code to find any errors in the provided script. Updated extended to append and switching the 'Open' and 'Close' in the two lines. 

### Sections

These sections contain more complex exercises grouped by topic (e.g., networking, file handling). They often build upon skills practiced in the labs.

- **[section_2/pinging.py](section_2/pinging.py)**: Contains the `ping_server` function to ping a list of IP addresses.
- **[section-4/chapter-4-exercises.py](section-4/chapter-4-exercises.py)**: Contains various string manipulation exercises.
- **[section_10/loops.py](section_10/loops.py)**: Contains the `department_count` function to count department entries.
- **[section_12/files.py](section_12/files.py)**: Contains functions for file operations, including `txt_to_list` and `get_ip_version`.
